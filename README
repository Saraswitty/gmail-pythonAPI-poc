A simple program that:
  Reads donor's and childern's information from a csv file.
  Creates a gmail draft email to be sent to each donor.
  Attaches the child's progress card to whom the donor donated to the draft.
  Sends the email.

To use the program:
  Login into gmail and go to this link: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps. Allow less secure app temporarily.  (Ya! :( )
  Modify username and password in email_donors.py 
  Run: python email_donors.py
